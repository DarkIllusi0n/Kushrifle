# Kush Rifle for TTT


## What does it do?
When a player gets shot with the weapon he/she hears a specific song and has distorted vision for a specified amount of time.
You can change the sound location and/or the song its self on line 123. Make sure you have FastDL set up or else the song will not play when a player is shot with it.
