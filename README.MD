# Kush Rifle for TTT


## What does it do?
When a player gets hit with the weapon they hear a specific song and has distorted vision for a specified amount of time.
The players name will also appear in chat when they are hit in the form of "PLAYER 420 Blazes it" for everyone to see. You can change the message on line 200.
The weapon's bullet damage is set to 1 by default feel free to change it. (line 150)
You can change the sound location and/or the song its self on line 123. Make sure you have FastDL set up or else the song will not play when a player is shot with it.
You can also change the amount of time the effect lasts on line 128.
